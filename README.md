Voltage Checker, Uni Assignment

The brief for this assingment was to read in a voltage from an electrical substation once per hour for six hours.
These voltages are then checked to display any voltages that differ from the average by more than 10% 
It also must display any pairs of consecutive hours where the change from the voltage at one hour to the next is greater than 15% of the average.
